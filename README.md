•	Backend (Node.Js) server that connects to a front end client (React).
•	Currency app with country data. So we will make use of API to provide data. 
•	Connect to that API https://restcountries.eu (country lookup and general information) and use the returned country data.
•	look up a country by name and returns the full name, population and a list of its official currencies including current exchange rate to SEK. 
•	Finally we have to search and add countries to a list displaying the full country name, population and currency 
•	enter an amount in SEK and get the amount converted into local currency next to each country in the list by connecting to the API http://free.currconv.com.
